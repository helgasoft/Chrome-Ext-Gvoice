Google Voice photo download
=====================
Chrome browser extension

## Problem
Your platform is Windows with the latest Chrome browser and you have a [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/messages) phone number.
Google Voice supports send/receive text messages with image/photo attachments. Downloading received photos, however, is inconvenient. You can download one image at a time with minimum 5 clicks (one to open, right-click, Save image as, Save, return arrow).

.

Two additional issues are that 1) any date information has to be manually
associated with the photos, as that information is neither included in the
filename nor the metadata, and 2) there is no easy way to download a large
number of photos with one click.

## Solution

This extension shows all photos of a thread (*conversation*) in a compact,
easy-to-scroll list. It provides a quick one-click download for **all** images
currently in view, and a list of clickable thumbnails to download **individual**
images. Images are named according to the date they were sent or received.

**Installation**:
 * [download ZIP](gvphoto.zip?raw=true) ►  unzip to a local folder
 * Chrome ►  Menu ![3 dots](src/three-dots.png?raw=true) ►  More Tools ►  Extensions (or just copy link *chrome://extensions/* into the address bar)
 * Set "Developer Mode" to On and keep it that way
 * Click button "Load Unpacked"
 * Select the folder with the files and hit Ok ► Chrome will show icon ![blue
   icon](src/gvphoto16.png?raw=true) in extensions menu ![menu](gv.btn.png) 


Downloading photos and images sent to your Google Voice number becomes much easier.   

Notes

 * Only photos currently loaded are displayed. To see older photos, scroll back to the older photos
before hitting the extension button.
 * Legacy Google Voice cannot use this extension
 * Chrome on Mobile Devices does not support extensions
 * Other extensions like AdGuard AdBlocker could disable downloads
